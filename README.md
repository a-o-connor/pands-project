## About this project
This repository contains a Python script and a Jupyter notebook with my own analysis of the Iris data set, for the purposes of the Programming and Scripting module I am taking as part of a course in Computer Science at ATU. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how Python can be used to analyse large datasets, and to use this analysis to provide a coherent overview of the Iris dataset. Detailed explanations and code comments are provided throughout to demonstrate understanding of the principles behind data analytics using Python.
