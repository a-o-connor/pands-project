## About this project
This repository contains a Python script and a Jupyter notebook with my own analysis of the Iris data set, for the purposes of the Programming and Scripting module I am taking as part of a course in Computer Science at ATU. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how Python can be used to analyse large datasets, and to use this analysis to provide a coherent overview of the Iris dataset. Detailed explanations and code comments are provided throughout to demonstrate understanding of the principles behind data analytics using Python. 

## The Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset that is widely used in statistics and data science as a training data set. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample includes four continuous, numerical variables describing the physical attributes of the flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The data was collected by botanist Edgar Anderson in 1934, where he found Iris flowers from both the Setosa and the Versicolor species growing in the same location: the Gaspe Peninsula in Quebec. The data for the Virginica species of the flower was collected much earlier and at a different location. These samples were taken in 1926 in Camden, Tennessee, and were later collated into the dataset. 

More information on this classic data set can be found in this [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-iris-data-set%3A-In-search-of-the-source-of-Unwin-Kleinman/4599862ea877863669a6a8e63a3c707a787d5d7e) published in Significance in 2021. The paper, titled "*The iris data set: In search of the source of virginica*", provides a neat overview of the data set that will be explored in this repository, and its significance in the data analysis and statistics community since it was first used an an example dataset by statistician [R. A. Fischer](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x) in 1936.
