## About 
*****
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook containing my analysis of the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris), a dataset that presents data on three different species of the iris flower. The iris dataset is  widely used in statistics and data science as a training data set.
### The Iris Data Set
More information on this classic data set can be found in this [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-iris-data-set%3A-In-search-of-the-source-of-Unwin-Kleinman/4599862ea877863669a6a8e63a3c707a787d5d7e) published in Significance in 2021. The paper, titled "*The iris data set: In search of the source of virginica*", provides a neat overview of the data set that will be explored in this notebook, and its significance in the data analysis and statistics community since its first use as an example data set by [R. A. Fischer](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x) in 1936.
