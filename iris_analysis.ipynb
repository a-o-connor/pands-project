    "This repository contains my analysis of the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris). The data set is available on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris), or the raw csv file can be found in the [Seaborn Data Repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv) on Github.\n",

    "### The Iris Data Set\n",
    "The iris dataset presents data on three different species of the Iris flower, and is often used in statistics and data science as a training data set. The data set contains information on the following four features from 150 different samples of iris flower:\n",
    "- Sepal length (cm)\n",
    "- Sepal width (cm)\n",
    "- Petal Length (cm)\n",
    "- Petal Width (cm)\n",
    "\n",
    "The flowers are categorized into 3 different species, listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iris setosa\n",
    "- Iris versicolor\n",
    "- Iris virginica\n",

The paper, titled \"*The iris data set: In search of the source of virginica*\", provides a neat overview of the data set that will be explored in this repository, and its significance in the data analysis and statistics community since its first use as an example data set by [R.

    "This repository contains a Python script and a Jupyter notebook with my own analysis of the Iris data set, for the purposes of the Programming and Scripting module I am taking as part of a course in Computer Science at ATU. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how Python can be used to analyse large datasets, and to use this analysis to provide a coherent overview of the Iris dataset. Detailed explanations and code comments are provided throughout to demonstrate understanding of the principles behind data analytics using Python. \n",

    "PCA is a dimension reduction tool that takes multiple variables and transforms them into a smaller set of variables (known as principal components) that still contain most of the information in the data set.\n",
    "- A principal component is a linear combination of the original set of variables: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.\n",
    "- The weight that each variable contributes to each principal component is its Eigenvalue, and its Eigenvector (neagtive or positive) indicates the direction that variable contributes to the PC. \n",
    "- The variables are combined in such a way that the most information, or variation, contained in the data is described by the least number of dimensions.\n",
    "- The original variables in the data frame are reduced to the same number of principal components, such that the greatest variance in the data is explained by the first few principal components. i.e. The first principal component will explain most of the variance in the data set, followed by PC2, followed by PC3 and so on.\n",
    "- In this way, a data frame is generated where most of the variation in the data is contained within the first two or three variables, which is much easier to visualise and analyse. \n",

    "    - [Scikit Learn PCA example with Iris Data-set](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_pca_iris.html)\n",
    "- The first step was to generate a PCA object with 5 components.  \n",
    "- This PCA object will be used to used to reduce the 5 variables in our data to 5 principal components. \n",
    "- The next step was to apply the ``fit_transform()`` function to the pca object to find the scores of each sample in the Iris data frame. The function can be applied to a numeric dataframe to determine the scores of each sample in the data set on each of the principal components. \n",
    "- This function returns a NumPy array with a column for each principal component and a row for each sample reporting its Eigenvector and Eigenvalue against each PC. \n",
    "- A 2D scores plot, coloured by species, was generated for principal component 1 and 2 by indexing the returned NumPy array. \n",
    "- This [tutorial on generating custom legends in Matplotlib](https://python-graph-gallery.com/custom-legend-with-matplotlib/), from the Matplotlib documentation, was followed in order to colour each point on the scores plot by species. \n",
    "- The next step was to generate a loadings matrix. \n",
    "- This tutorial on Github on [How to compute PCA loadings and the loading matrix](https://scentellegher.github.io/machine-learning/2020/01/27/pca-loadings-sklearn.html#:~:text=Loadings%20with%20scikit%2Dlearn&text=The%20columns%20of%20the%20dataframe,to%20the%20corresponding%20principal%20component) was used.\n",
    "- The loadings matrix  describes the magnitude of the contribution of individual variables toward each component. \n",
    "- To compute the loadings of each variable, the ``components_`` of the PCA object must be accessed.\n",
    "- These were coverted into a Panda's Dataframe, that could be indexed to generate a loadings plot. \n",
    "- Each point in the loadings plot was labelled with the name of the variable it pertained to, by applying the function ``enumerate()`` to the list of column names in the original data frames. This returns a number and a list item which can be assigned the variables i, and column and iterated through in a for loop to annotate each point in the scatterplot individually. \n",
    "- [This Matplotlib tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/examples/mplot3d/text3d_demo.html) on use of the ``annotate()`` function to label each point in a scatterplot in Matplotlib was used to label each variable in the Loadings plot. \n",
    "- The [Matplotlib user guide](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/text/annotations.html#sphx-glr-users-explain-text-annotations-py) on annotation and text in Matplotlib was also very useful in generating this code."
