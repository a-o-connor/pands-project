    "## 4. Multivariate Data Analysis\n",
    "While the bivariate analysis carried out thus far was successful in identifying correlations between each of the variables, with this type of analysis it is often not possible to visualize so many variables at once. Analysis in a univariate or bivariate manner cannot capture interactions occuring between variables that might be contributing to variation in the data. In order to appropriately analyze the entire data set, multivariate analysis through PCA was carried out.\n",
    "### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "PCA is a dimension reduction tool that takes multiple variables and transforms them into a smaller set of variables (known as principal components) that still contain most of the information in the data set.\n",
    "- A principal component is a linear combination of the original set of variables. \n",
    "- The weight that each variable contributes to each principal component is its Eigenvalue, and its Eigenvector (negative or positive) indicates the direction that variable contributes to the PC. \n",
    "- The variables are combined in such a way that most of the or variation in the dataset can be described by the least number of dimensions.\n",
    "- Principal components are ranked in order of importance, i.e. The first principal component will explain most of the variance in the data set, followed by PC2, followed by PC3 and so on.\n",
    "- In this way, a data frame is generated where most of the variation in the data is contained within the first two or three variables, which is much easier to visualise and analyse. \n",

    "# CONCLUSION\n",
    "The Iris dataset contains size data gathered for three species of Iris flower. The data set contains both continuous numeric variables and nominal categorical variables. Plotting the numeric data on histograms revealed distinct distributions among the continuous variables, with petal width and sepal length displaying a trimodal pattern of distribution, while petal length had a bimodal distribution. Separation of these variables by species revelaed that the multimodal distributions observed within the variables was due to distinct distributions for each of the species measured. A more in depth analysis of the correlations within the data set was then carried out. It was found that sepal length and petal length were positively correlated with petal width. This was supported by linear regression analysis that revealed a highly significant relationship. Using bar charts to display the mean by species for each attribute showed that petal length and sepal length varied the most between species. Boxplots of these two variables were built to allow for a more in depth analysis of the differences between species. The correlation between species and petal length within the data set was explored further. A t-test was carried out that indicated a statistically significant difference in petal length between the Virginica and Versicolor species of Iris flower. A Oneway ANOVA was used to identify the statistical significance of the difference in sepal length between the 3 species. Principal component analysis was then performed in order to capture any interactions between the variables that might be not captured by analysing the data in a univariate or bivariate manner. PCA revealed that the variable contributing the most to variation within the data set was petal length, and the differences in petal length between the samples was primarily due to species.  \n",

    "The analysis contained in this notebook offers a deeper understanding of the variation between the samples in the Iris dataset, providing an insight into the biology of the Iris flower. "
