    "## The Iris Data Set\n",
    "**************\n",
    "- Loading the data set from [Seaborn Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overview of the Data \n",
    "- Text file containing a summary of each numeric variable available, to provide an overview of the Iris Data set and the types of variables in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "- EDA first step in order to get an overview of the data, to identify anomalies and ensure the data set has been loaded in correctly.\n",
    "- Histograms of each the numeric variables in the data frame were made in order to visualise and explore the distribution of each of the numeric variables.\n",
    "- Histograms are a good way to present continuous data, as they provide a visualisation of:\n",
    "    - Where the distribution is centered\n",
    "    - The spread of the distribution\n",
    "    - The shape of the distribution  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Correlations\n",
    "- wanted to plot a line of best fit and report the r value for the linear regressions in each scatterplot .. blah bla explain more!! \n",
    "- Assessing Fit Of A Linear Regression Model: R Squared\n",
    "- A linear regression model’s R Squared value describes the proportion of variance explained by the model.7\n",
    "- A value of 1 means that all of the variance in the data is explained by the model, and the model fits the data well. \n",
    "- A value of 0 means that none of the variance is explained by the model.\n",
    "- Bar charts and box plots were plotted to explore the differences in penguin attributes between species.\n",
    "- Box plots: Wanted to explore the differences in petal length and sepal length between species as these seemed to vary most\n",
    "**Interpretation of Box Plot**\n",
    "- Box plots are a useful plot to determine the spread of data within a group and identify potential outliers. \n",
    "- The boxes represent the interquartile range. The box limits represent the spread of the central 50% of the data. \n",
    "- The Virginica species has the longest box, indicating a greater variance (or, wider spread) of the data points within the group. There is a wider spread of petal lengths within the Virginica species of Iris.  \n",
    "- The horizontal lines in the boxes are the median line. The group median petal length for the Setosa species is the lowest, and the least variance is seen in this group. \n",
    "- Versicolour and virginica both have higherr group median\n",
    "- The whiskers extend to the furthest data point in the data set that is within $ \\pm 1.5\\times $ IQR. \n",
    "- Outliers are represented by points that fall outside the boxplot whiskers. Versicolour species has one outliers, one plant has a petal length significantly smaller than others of that species measured.\n",
    "- Setosa sepcies has 4 outliers \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sspecies vs Petal Length: \n",
    "**Students *t*-test**\n",
    "*******************\n",
    "- A students *t*-test is used to explore how the distribution of the response (e.g. petal length) differs across groups (species). \n",
    "- Below, an Independent Two Samples t-test is used to determine if there is a correlation between petal length and species through assessing whether differences in body mass between the two sexes are statistically significant. \n",
    "- An **Independent Samples *t*-test** should be performed to determine the statistical significance of this difference in group means.\n",
    "- **Interpretation of the Independent Samples *t*-test**\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ = 0.05: This is the significance level. There is a 5% chance that the null hypothesis will be incorrectly accepted or rejected. \n",
    "- *p*-value $\\le$ 0.05: A calculated significance probability less than the predetermined significance level indicates that the null hypothesis should be rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference in the group means.   \n",
    "- From the t-test performed, there is a statistically significant difference in petal length between the species. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Species vs Sepal Length: Oneway ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### PCA: \n",
    "From the pariplot, there seems to be separation of the cluster from the setosa species. \n",
    "Bivariate analysis such as the correlation analysis above is useful for interpretation of ... but does not capture interactions that might be occurring between variables contributing to variation within the data set.\n",
    "**Principal Components:**\n",
    "PCA is a dimension reduction tool that takes multiple variables and transforms them into a smaller set of variables (known as principal components) that still contain most of the information in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA was used to reduce the 5 variables in our data to the same number of principal components, such that the greatest variance in the data is explained by the first few principal components. \n",
    "i.e. The first principal component explains most of the variance in the data set, followed by PC2, followed by PC3 and so on.\n",
    "**Scores plot:**\n",
    "The scores plot is a 2 dimensional representation of samples across the 2 first principle components. The Score plot is the first plot presented. Each point on the scores plot in a score plot represents a sample.\n",
    "Samples that are similar will group (cluster) together.\n",
    "Exploration of how samples (or clusters of samples) are separated along the PCs reveals which variables are influencing the separation of different groups.   \n",
    "If samples are separated along the PC2 axis, that means whatever variable has a high loading on PC2 contributes to the variation between the samples.\n",
    "**Loadings plot:** \n",
    "The Loadings plot describes the magnitude of the contribution of individual variables toward each component. The closer the variable is to the origin (loading of 0 on both PC1 and PC2), the less important that variable is for explaining the variance in the data.\n",
    "- These variables are clustered together in the loadings plot therefore they are positively correlated.\n",
    "- variables are inversely correlated with those listed above, as they are located on the opposite side of the origin.\n",
    "- Variable X strongly to PC1. \n",
    "- Variables contributing strongly to PC2 include… \n",
    "- Interpretation of where each sample falls on the scores plot and the variables lying in the corresponding area in the loadings plot can reveal which variables are contributing to the variation in that cluster of samples.   \n",
    "**Scree Plot**\n",
    "The scree plot shows how much variance in the data set (i.e. how much information) is explained by each of the principal components\n",
    "•\tPC1 captures X% of the information comprised in the data. \n",
    "•\tPC2 captures X% of the information comprised in the data.\n",
    "•\tPC1 and PC2 alone can explain X % of the variance in the data.\n"
